Hi there from the SustainIndyFoods.com team! You recently told us you were interested in buying a gift card to support {place_name}. They now have a link where you can do this online:

{gift_card_url}

Not sure how much to spend? Consider a gift card for one month’s worth of your usual spending there, if you’re able. Thank you for doing your part to keep our local businesses around. We hope you are safe and healthy.

Thanks,
The SustainIndyFoods team
